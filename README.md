# OWQ - Open Web Query v.1.0.1 (dev) #

OWQ is a dedicated scripting language (bytecode-compiled VM system), written in C++.
It allows execution of `.owq` scripts written with an JS like syntax that exposes a powerful
Web-Scraping and Web based data extraction API.
OWQ is a programmable virtual machine that allows to program Scraping and Crawling Tasks that 
are executed natively and returns the retrieved dataset of the "Web Query" (Scraping) you programmed.
 
### Language Capabilities ###

* **No type declaration** Variables (integer, double, string, boolean, dataset)  
* **Global variable** - Scoped base declaration with a global scope.
* **Functions**.
* **LOOPS** - `while, for`
* **Conditions**
* **Console Debugger** - `print, rep`.
* **Core Functions** - A good and well optimized standard library with data extraction orientation.
* **Bot Functions** - Directly controls web bot behavior, steps, goals and targets.
* **Object Like variables** - All variables has a JS prototype like API such as `length, substr, trim, slice` and many more.
* **Full target DOM traversal API**
* **Full Support of JS script execution** against a target web page with return support.
* **DataSets** - define and build complex data structures to store results.
* **Casting** - `numbers, strings, JSON, XML, CSV`
* **Imports** - reuse of codes by importing them into your script.

### Web bot capabilities ###
* **Virtual web browser** - loads pages with all executed (CSS, Images, JS and other resources)
* **Realtime JS execution**
* **Cookies control**
* **User agent control**
* **Dynamic DOM** - will hold DOM with any change made even by JS DOM manipulation.
* **Control resources** - control which resources a page should load.
* **Download files and resources**.
* **Print screen of web page**.
* **Display control** - control the viewport of a web page.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Internet connection.
* Pre build executable.
* Done! you can start programming and executing Open Web Queries.
